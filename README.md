# Extrovert vs Introvert Project
Welcome to the Extrovert vs Introvert Analysis Project, a Jupyter Notebook-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project. This repository provides insights into a sample dataset, demonstrating how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python's most powerful data science libraries.

## Project Structure

``` bash

â”œâ”€â”€ sample.ipynb       # Main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Project overview and instructions (this file)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Python dependencies 
```

## Features
- Data Import using pandas
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates
- Statistical Overview: Descriptive statistics and data types
- Visualization: Using matplotlib and seaborn for plots
- Correlation Analysis and insights
- Well-commented code for ease of understanding

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
- numpy for numerical operations

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
``` bash 
 git clone https://github.com/HasnainB47/Extrovert-vs-Introvert-EDA.git
 cd Extrovert-vs-Introver
```
2. Install Dependencies
You can install the required packages using pip:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the essentials:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
3. Launch the Notebook
```
jupyter notebook sample.ipynb
```

### Example Outputs
- Missing Data Heatmap
- Correlation Matrix
- Bar Charts and Histograms
- Boxplots for Outlier Detection


### Use Cases
- This notebook serves as a great starting point for:
- Learning how to perform EDA
- Academic or professional data science projects
- Building dashboards or machine learning pipelines

### To-Do
 - Add machine learning model integration (e.g., regression/classification)
- Deploy analysis as a web dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash
- Add unit tests for data cleaning functions
